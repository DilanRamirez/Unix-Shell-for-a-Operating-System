# Unix-Shell-for-a-Operating-System

## Description
Your shell should meet the following requirements:
 * 1. Prints a prompt string specified by shell variable PS1 when expecting a command (if PS1
is not set, the default prompt should be "$ ").
 * 2. Accepts the standard unix command shell syntax for specifying commands and
parameters
     * o Your shell should create a child process that uses execve to run the command with
its parameters.
      * If an absolute path is not specified, your shell should instead find it using the
$PATH environment variable.
      * The parent process should wait for the child to terminate before printing another
command prompt.
 * 3. Handles expected user error.
      * Prints "command not found" if the command is not found. For example, if the
user tries to run program lx and this program doesn't exist, the shell should
respond with "lx: command not found".
      * If the command fails (with a non-zero exit value N), your shell should print
"Program terminated with exit code N."
 * 4. Provides the following built-in commands.
      * The "exit" command should cause your shell to terminate.
      * Change directories with the "cd" command.
 * 5. Redirection of input and output (e.g. $ ls > /tmp/files.txt).
 * 6. Simple pipes (e.g. $ ls | sort -r).
 * 7. Background tasks (e.g. $ find /etc -print & )
Your program should be written in C or C++
